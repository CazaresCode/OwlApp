## General info
Owl satisfies Eleven Fifty Academyâ€™s Red Badge Final project. You have about 14 days to design and build a function ASP.NET MVC Application while learning new technologies along the way.
	
## Technologies
Project is created with:
* ASP.NET MVC
* GitHub
* Bootstrap
* Jquery
* Visual Studio Community 2019
* HTML5/CSS3
* Microsoft Azure
	
## Installation
It is highly recommended to use Visual Studio 2019 Community. You may download the free application by [clicking here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).

## Usage
You can either clone it or register at [Owl](https://owlwebmvc20210713210144.azurewebsites.net/Home/Index).

You must create a Person (Student or Faculty) and a Meeting before creating a new Participation.
A Person is a participate at your festivial, as well as a Faculty. 
A Meeting is an event that occurs at your festivial. 
A Participation joins a Person and Meeting together, thus allowing a many-to-many relationship.

Next, you are able to filter and sort the data in each table. The Person and Meeting tables have dynamic properties, which some of them count based on its title. When you click in the details of a person, it produces a list of the Person's Meetings. And the same goes for the Meetings.

You can edit and delete the entities.
